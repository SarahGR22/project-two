Project was completed in collaboration with Hawa Abdo and Sarah Gutierrez.

For our ETL project, we built an ETL pipeline using Python, Python dictionary, and Pandas methods in order to extract and transform the given data sources. We then transformed the data which allowed us the ability to create four CSV files and use these files to create an ERD and a table schema.
